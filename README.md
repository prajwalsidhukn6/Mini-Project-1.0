# Problem statement : Design and Implementation of 0/1 Knapsack Problem Using Genetic Algorithm in Python

# Abstract

  In this project, we used an improved genetic algorithm (GA) is to solve the 0-1
knapsack problem (KP). The KP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem and
has received wide attention from the operations research community for decades. Although
recent advances in computing and optimization technologies have made the solution of
small and medium-size instances possible, this NP-hard problem, in general, still remains
one of the challenging problems yet to be solved.

  Of the various algorithms developed to solve the KP, GA seems to be one of the
best methods pointed out in the literature. A GA is an iterative search procedure that
simulates the evolution process of a population of individuals based on natural selection
and genetics. A GA typically starts with a random initial population and uses genetic
operators such as crossover and mutation to yield new offspring to replace individuals of
the current population. GAs, though have been successful in solving KPs, could be slow in
converging to an optimal or near-optimal solution.
